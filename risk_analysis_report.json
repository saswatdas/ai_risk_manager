While technical and functional readiness is on track, issues related to Market Data Agreements with ICE exchange and internal reorganization affecting pilot participation suggest that some areas need further attention to formally mobilize.",
          "recommendation": "To achieve a Green rating, ensure all requirements, especially related to Market Data Agreements and pilot customer participation, are comprehensively defined and documented.

There are unresolved issues concerning the Market Data Agreements with ICE exchange critical for the go-live, and security developments are slightly behind plan, impacting the PEN test timeline. This indicates that additional time and work are needed to resolve these challenges before the solution\u200b can be fully defined and considered ready.",
          "recommendation": "To achieve a Green rating, immediately prioritize resolving the Market Data Agreements with ICE exchange, and address any security developments impacting the PEN test timeline.

          "recommendation": "To improve the rating to Green, the project team should establish a detailed capacity or scope-based budget estimate with defined confidence levels. Address any pending agreements or external dependencies impacting budget predictions and ensure a more data-driven approach to future budget estimations."
