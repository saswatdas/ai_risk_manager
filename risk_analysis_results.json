This release includes a set of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, along with additional changes supporting the Externalization capability, which is targeted to go live later this quarter. 21st Aug - A Disaster Recovery (DR) capability proving exercise is scheduled for 21st August as part of our annual operational resilience strategy. This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n\n Carefully read the text with sections name mentioned below (if present),collate them and find evidence that matches the criteria above:\n --- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY --- \n --- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\n --- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\n --- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\n --- COMMENTS ON BUDGET ---\n --- COMMENTS ON COST ---\n --- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\n --- COMMENTS ON SCOPE ---\n --- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\n --- BUSINESS VALUE ---\n        Your output MUST be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n        {\n            \"optic_name\": \"firmness_of_opportunity\",\n            \"rating\": \"Red | Amber | Green\",\n            \"justification\": \"The direct quote from the text that proves your rating.

This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

However, the exact start date of the IT effort isn't explicitly provided, leading to a tentative understanding that activities have timelines extending around end of September and decisions expected end of August.

This indicates that while business value is being considered, it is still in the process of refinement, which fits the criteria for 'Amber: Benefits case in progress / needs revisiting'.

This release includes a set of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, along with additional changes supporting the Externalization capability, which is targeted to go live later this quarter. 21st Aug - A Disaster Recovery (DR) capability proving exercise is scheduled for 21st August as part of our annual operational resilience strategy. This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

This release includes a set of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, along with additional changes supporting the Externalization capability, which is targeted to go live later this quarter. 21st Aug - A Disaster Recovery (DR) capability proving exercise is scheduled for 21st August as part of our annual operational resilience strategy. This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

This release includes a set of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, along with additional changes supporting the Externalization capability, which is targeted to go live later this quarter. 21st Aug - A Disaster Recovery (DR) capability proving exercise is scheduled for 21st August as part of our annual operational resilience strategy. This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

This release includes a set of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, along with additional changes supporting the Externalization capability, which is targeted to go live later this quarter. 21st Aug - A Disaster Recovery (DR) capability proving exercise is scheduled for 21st August as part of our annual operational resilience strategy. This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

This release includes a set of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, along with additional changes supporting the Externalization capability, which is targeted to go live later this quarter. 21st Aug - A Disaster Recovery (DR) capability proving exercise is scheduled for 21st August as part of our annual operational resilience strategy. This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

This release includes a set of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, along with additional changes supporting the Externalization capability, which is targeted to go live later this quarter. 21st Aug - A Disaster Recovery (DR) capability proving exercise is scheduled for 21st August as part of our annual operational resilience strategy. This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.

This critical activity ensures our ability to recover services during major incidents, supports compliance requirements, and reinforces confidence in our failover and recovery capabilities. For this activity, the focus will be on proving DR capability for DSX, excluding other components (AES &amp; DSP) from this exercise.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nLast Month Achievements: 8th July - Trading Technologies (TT) released an updated TTFIX.crt file, which contained the public certificates required for connectivity to TT\u2019s FIX endpoint. These certificates are subject to annual renewal and must be updated to maintain uninterrupted service. TT recommended that the updated file be implemented prior to 11th July, as the existing certificates were due to expire on that date. The update was successfully applied to AES Production on Tuesday, 8th July at 8 PM UK. 17th July - Successfully established and enabled AES-to-TT VPN connectivity in Production, transitioning from public internet to a secure VPN channel for enhanced reliability and security. 17th July - DSX v115, AES v5.8 &amp; DSP v2.69 were successfully deployed to Production, marking a key milestone in our strategic roadmap. This release delivered new features and enhancements, and also included foundational changes supporting upcoming Externalization and FX Hedging capabilities, both scheduled to go live later this year.\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-10-01 13:27:21\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: test1\n\n--- LAST UPDATED ---\n2025-09-01 17:29:08\n\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\nExecutive Summary: Progress &amp; Success: Negotiations with Kinaxis on licenses is near completion, work is in progress on the timeline and cost for the blueprinting, design &amp; detailed planning phase.IDT &amp; Business cost estimates have been completed for the GIP.
