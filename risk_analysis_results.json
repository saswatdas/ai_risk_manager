UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production. Successfully conclude User Acceptance Testing by June 20th, according to the schedule.\u2022 Secure ATD and raise change request for prod deployment. \u2022 Initiate production cutover activities with the support team by executing the deployment plan.\u2022 Provide the deployment scripts to the support team, once the final UAT sign-off is secured. \u2022 Coordinate with various IDSO teams to ensure readiness for production deployment.\n\n--- LAST MONTH ACHIEVEMENTS ---\nSecured partial sign-off for the frontend i.e. UI &amp; UX. The final UAT sign-off to be received once the backend test cases are completed. Technical documentation has been finalized and shared with the support team, enhancing project readiness. \u2022 Knowledge transfer sessions with the support team have been completed.\u2022 A baseline user manual has been shared with the business team.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.

UAT test cases (Data validation) execution is ongoing, and the development team is working on addressing defect/bug fixes. We aim to complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by June 20th, unless we encounter any bug/defect that may require additional time to resolve. Once we receive the final UAT sign-off, we will kick off the production cutover activities. As it stands, we are on track to go live during the week of June 30th. Challenges &amp; RTGs: Schedule (AMBER): The project status has shifted to Amber due to a dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team, which is currently experiencing data discrepancy issues with the OMM data in Production. The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is actively working with the OMM and PCD teams to resolve these issues and ensure accurate data flow from OMM to AMDP for HVO B7. If the data discrepancies in AMDP production are not resolved before the planned go-live date we will delay the go-live.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON SCHEDULE ---\nChallenge: The project has transitioned to an Amber status due to its dependency on the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP), which is managed by the Chemicals &amp; Products CoB team. Currently, they are experiencing discrepancies with the OMM production data in AMDP. Return to Green: The Chemicals &amp; Products IDT team is collaborating with the OMM and PCD teams to address the prod issue and ensure that the correct data flows from OMM to AMDP, enabling HVO B7 to function properly - Commitment for the fix to be in place by 25th June. If the data in the AMDP production environment is not corrected before our planned go-live date, it will impact the project&#39;s schedule.\n\n--- COMMENTS ON RESOURCES ---\nWorked with CC team and managed to retain the primary data engineer to continue work on the project, hence the associated risk is mitigated now and Resourcing status moved back to Green.\n\n--- GENERAL COMMENTS ---\nChemical and Products team is working on fixing the Asset Management Data Platform prod issue. \u2022 UAT is progressing as per plan, targeted to be completed by June 20th.\n\n--- KEY ACTIVITIES PLANNED ---\nAMDP team to fix the data issue at their end for providing OMM data to the B7 project team to consume in production.
