task_breakdown:
  description: >
    Carefully analyze the project_requirements for the {project_type}
    project and break them down into individual tasks. Define each
    task's scope in detail, set achievable timelines, and ensure that
    all dependencies are accounted for:

    {project_requirements}


    Team members:

    {team_members}
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of tasks with detailed descriptions, timelines,
    dependencies, and deliverables. Your final output MUST include a
    Gantt chart or similar timeline visualization specific to the
    {project_type} project.

time_resource_estimation:
  description: >
    Thoroughly evaluate each task in the {project_type} project to
    estimate the time, resources, and effort required.
    Use historical data, task complexity, and available resources to
    provide a realistic estimation for each task.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed estimation report outlining the time, resources, and
    effort required for each task in the {project_type} project.
    Your final report MUST include a summary of any risks or
    uncertainties associated with the estimations.

resource_allocation:
  description: >
    Strategically allocate tasks for the {project_type} project to
    team members based on their skills, availability, and current
